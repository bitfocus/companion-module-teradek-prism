It is recommended to use the presets as much as possible as there are a lot of actions, variables, and feedbacks that work together.

The actions are separated into the following categories:

**Recording**

- Start/Stop

**Setting Fie Name**

- File name for next recording

**Record With Name**
_This action sets the fie name and triggers record_

-File name for this recording

**Setting Stream Info**
_Settings currently only work for RTMP mode_

- Stream Name
- Username
- Password
- Stream URL
- Stream Key

**Streaming**

_Depending on your streaming platform, you may need to determine which of these actions will control your stream. The default is Publish/Unpublish._

- Publish
- Unpublish
- Broadcast
- Halt
- Cancel
- Preview
- End Preview
